              "description": "Creates, updates, or removes resources. This method supports atomic transactions with multiple types of resources. For example, you can atomically create a campaign and a campaign budget, or perform up to thousands of mutates atomically. This method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate methods. The only features it offers over calling those methods directly are: - Atomic transactions - Temp resource names (described below) - Somewhat reduced latency over making a series of mutate calls Note: Only resources that support atomic transactions are included, so this method can't replace all calls to individual services. ## Atomic Transaction Benefits Atomicity makes error handling much easier. If you're making a series of changes and one fails, it can leave your account in an inconsistent state. With atomicity, you either reach the chosen state directly, or the request fails and you can retry. ## Temp Resource Names Temp resource names are a special type of resource name used to create a resource and reference that resource in the same request. For example, if a campaign budget is created with `resource_name` equal to `customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1`, that resource name can be reused in the `Campaign.budget` field in the same request. That way, the two resources are created and linked atomically. To create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the part of the name that the server would normally allocate. Note: - Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused. For example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if the mutate order was reversed. - Temp names are not remembered across requests. - There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request. - Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the resource types differ. ## Latency It's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time out and fail. Latency is roughly equal to a series of calls to individual mutate methods, where each change in resource type is a new call. For example, mutating 10 campaigns then 10 ad groups is like 2 calls, while mutating 1 campaign, 1 ad group, 1 campaign, 1 ad group is like 4 calls.
